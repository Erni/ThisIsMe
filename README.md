# This is Me
Me and my interaction with others and the world

## What this is about
This document´s purpose is to let other people know me, specially colleagues that are going to work and spend time with me.
This will allow others to get to know me better and what you can expect from me as your coworker and (likely) friend-to-be.
Although I will describe me and my visions about work and the world in general, I am not writing this as a mean to let you know my expectations for you, or what I would like you be or how to behave with me.
At the time of this writing, I am new at Elastic (less than a month) and due to the number of people from many different cultures and nationalities at Elastic, this can be helpful for you if we ever have further interaction :)

## Basic introduction
My full name is Ernesto Reig Álvarez. I am 35 years old. I live in Alicante (Spain). My partner and fellow in life, Isis, is currently pregnant. Robin (the baby) is due in two weeks (06/06/2018), so we expect to have her soon between us :)
I was born in Alcoy, close to Alicante city. I lived there for my first 21 years. I graduated in Computer Science (3 years) in Alcoi, then I moved to Valencia to get the higher degree in Software Engineering (2 years more) in 2008.
I love science, nature, animals and wildlife. I train callisthenics and I´m a board game geek.

## Sports and fitness
I believe in a balance between body and mind. I try to be as fit as possible (physically and mentally). In the past I used to be a Triathlete, but my real passion has always been sports where I can enjoy nature and exercise at the same time. That way I gradually migrated from Triathlon to Canyoning and Rock Climbing. I love adrenaline. I admit it. It is a natural drug that makes you an addict before you can even notice. I had been doing the most amazing and difficult canyons in Spain and Europe (Ticino in Switzerland). I gave up Canyoning due to the high risk you are constantly exposed to. There are levels in which you are not in control of your life anymore... Rock Climbing is the sport in which I have a constant challenge to improve and reach higher grades, you are always in nature and can be enjoyed with families and friends. I train Calisthenics as part of the training form climbing.
